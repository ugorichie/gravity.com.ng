Gravity_Solution is a web app targeted at bridging the gap between qualified engineers and 
potential clients who have their needs of building or structuring houses. 

The aim of the web application is to reduce the incessant lost of lives,
properties and money through structure and house collapse. 
Our survey carried out show that (8 - 15) houses collapse every year in the country, and only about 10% of these damages are reported. 
These casualties are seen to be mostly due to poor structure of the building which in turn traces down to the engineers involved, 
therefore the need to tackle this rising problem.

A measure to cut undeserving , unqualified engineers off the system became a necessity,
hence the birth of Gravity_Solutions
